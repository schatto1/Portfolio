# Shumon Chattopadhyay's Portfolio

This will be a portfolio that will showcase all of the work I have done, both professionally and on the side.

Currently it only contains a bunch of photos of red pandas (my favorite), and some bacon ipsum quotes (did someone's stomach just gurgle?).

Originally created at CodePen.io as part of a coding challenge for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). You can find this Pen at https://codepen.io/schatto1/pen/pawwdV.
